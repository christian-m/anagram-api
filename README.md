# Anagram comparison API

## Introduction

This is a web service with REST API to compare texts if they are an anagram of each other.

## Motivation

* Using Kotlin, because I learned to love it the past years
* Using Maven, because I haven't used it a long time and want to see how it behave with Kotlin
* Using Ktor that I never used before, just out of curiosity (wouldn't do that in a productive project though ;-))
